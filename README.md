# VirtualDesktop-Widget

Simple widget which indexes shitdows virtual desktops and allows to move around.

Build with NET6.

Uses VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll for accessing Virtual Desktop API.
After building the .exe, copy the dll in the root folder.
Works perfectly in combination with the AHK script in /ahk folder

Enjoy and have fun
